# NBA Salary - A mini-analysis

Welcome to my fun summer project working with NBA data!

## Introduction

There are many steps taken in the data science lifecycle before ever getting to report writing and presenting insights with visualizations. From experience, there are steps that can be more tedious and challenging than others, but overall it's good practice to work through a data science project from beginning to end. This project aims to do just that - work through the data science lifecycle and share my experience. I use visualizations to make simple inferences on how NBA team salaries affect performance and how salary relates to other attributes like team experience. The final deliverables are a "blog-post" style report and published Shiny App web visualizations. 

## Repo Breakdown

- Code: This directory contains a series of R scripts and R markdown files used to acquire my data, merge relevent features, explore the data while answering some hypothesis questions, and code for building my published Shiny App web visualizations.

- Report: This directory contains all the files needed to run my final "blog post" style report. You can go directly to the blog post [here]().

- Data: This directory contains one file - my final, clean data frame used for exploratory data analysis.

## Data Source

All data for this project came from an online website called [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

## Video

Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsHwMV5i2gM) I made which quickly explains my project and walks a user through my web visualizations.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to acknowledge Dr. Gaston Sanchez in the UC Berkeley statistics department. This project is a piece of a larger collaboration between myself and a couple other peers who've excelled in a stats class with Dr. Sanchez. The final result is a compilation of all students' experience working through the data science lifecycle with NBA data and our experience publishing an interactive web visualization with R's Shiny App. The larger project is to be published online in a bookdown format in the coming months. So, this project would not have been possible without Dr. Sanchez's guidance and collaboration. Thank you, Dr. Sanchez for this opportunity and for the experience that will enable me to work on my own passion projects in the future!
